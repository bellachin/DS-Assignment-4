# DS-Assignment-4 Description

This assignment involves analyzing and visualizing a dataset containing information about substance use treatment admissions in New York State. The objective is to load, preprocess, and analyze the data, uncover patterns, and present insights using Python's technical features. The assignment begins with loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame directly from a URL, followed by data type conversions to ensure variables are represented in their appropriate types (e.g., converting categorical fields). Missing values are addressed through imputation using the mode of the respective column. Data exploration involves creating visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, and line charts, to display distributions of admissions across age groups, program categories, and primary substance groups. Advanced functionality is implemented through custom Python functions, such as `annualAdmissions()` for calculating and visualizing yearly admissions trends with annotations, and `annualAdmissionsByCounty(year)` for determining the proportional distribution of admissions across counties in a given year. The assignment leverages libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, preprocessing, and storytelling through data.
